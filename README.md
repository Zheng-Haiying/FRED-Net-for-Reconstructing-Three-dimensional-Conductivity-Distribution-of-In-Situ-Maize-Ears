# FRED-Net-for-Reconstructing-Three-dimensional-Conductivity-Distribution-of-In-Situ-Maize-Ears
This is the open-source code for a research paper titled “Reconstructing Three-dimensional Conductivity Distribution of In-Situ Maize Ears Using Frequency-Enhanced Residual Encoder-Decoder Network.” I will provide full reproducibility after the paper is accepted.
